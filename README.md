🎯 Obstacle_Assault — Dodge Hard. Fall Fast. Respawn Faster. 🌀⚡

Built in Unreal Engine 5 with precision C++ code (powered by VS Code wizardry 🧙‍♂️💻), Obstacle_Assault is a fast-paced 3D challenge course where chaos meets control. 💥

Your mission? Sprint, jump, and time your every move as you dodge:

🔨 Spinning hammers that love knocking players off their path
🪵 Collapsing platforms designed to betray your trust
🪤 Devious traps that reset your progress in a blink
All leading to one goal: that glorious castle at the finish line 🏰.

But make no mistake — this isn’t just about getting there. It’s about:

🎮 Twitch reflexes
⏱️ Precision timing
🧠 Level knowledge
💪 Relentless trial and error
Fall off? Respawn instantly. Get smacked mid-jump? See you at the start. Reach the castle? You're not just good — you're a gamer god. 🏆

This project is a showcase of game feel, movement mechanics, C++ scripting, and Unreal Engine gameplay systems all firing at once.

So…
⚔️ Do you survive the assault?
👑 Or does the assault survive you?
